# docs-media — Media Analysis

## Before Starting

1. **Get the repository.** Ask for the GitHub repo URL or `{user}/{repo}`.
2. **Check Docsbook.** Run `mcp__docsbook__list_workspaces` to find the workspace.
   - If found → use `mcp__docsbook__get_doc_graph` and `mcp__docsbook__read_doc_sections` to scan image references in markdown.
   - If not found → offer to add it first.
3. **Check the graph.** If `get_doc_graph` returns an empty graph or no data → run `mcp__docsbook__reindex_doc_graph` to generate it, then retry. If it returns a stale warning, offer to reindex before proceeding.
3. **Two levels of analysis.** From Docsbook MCP, detect issues visible in markdown (missing alt, generic filenames in links, missing captions). Physical file checks (size, age) require local repo access — note which checks need it.
4. **Skip if no media.** If `read_doc_sections` finds no image or video references, skip this skill.

## Core Principles

### 1. Text is primary, media amplifies
Images, videos, and diagrams should strengthen the text — not replace it. A page that is 80% screenshots is an anti-pattern.

### 2. Stability over beauty
UI changes. Full-page screenshots go stale fastest. For frequently-changing UI, a text description ages better than a screenshot.

### 3. Lightweight by default
Large media files slow page load and hurt SEO. PNG screenshots under 500 KB, GIF under 2 MB.

### 4. Diagrams as code
A Mermaid diagram in markdown versions with the code, renders automatically, and updates in a PR. A static PNG requires a designer and goes stale silently.

## Checklist

### File Formats

| Content type | Recommended format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| UI screenshot | PNG (or WebP) | Sharp text; never JPG for UI |
| Photo / illustration | WebP > JPG | Natural images |
| Short animation | GIF or MP4 | ≤ 5 seconds |
| Long video | YouTube/Loom embed | > 5 seconds — do not commit video files |
| Architecture diagram | Mermaid in markdown | Code-first, versions in git |
| Logo / icon | SVG | Scalable, no quality loss |

- [ ] **PNG for UI screenshots** — not JPG (JPG degrades text rendering)
- [ ] **GIF only for short animations** — ≤ 5 seconds, ≤ 2 MB
- [ ] **No video files committed** to the repo — use YouTube, Loom, or Vimeo embeds
- [ ] **Mermaid preferred over static PNG** for diagrams and flowcharts

### File Size (local repo check)

- [ ] **PNG screenshot < 500 KB**
- [ ] **GIF < 2 MB**
- [ ] **Total media per page < 5 MB**
- [ ] **No MP4/MOV files** committed to repo

```bash
# Find large media files
find . -type f \( -name '*.png' -o -name '*.jpg' -o -name '*.gif' -o -name '*.mp4' \) -size +500k -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

### File Names (detectable from markdown links)

- [ ] **kebab-case** — `workspace-settings-api-keys.png`
- [ ] **Descriptive** — name describes content, not position: not `screenshot1.png`, `image.png`, `Screenshot 2024-01-15.png`
- [ ] **No spaces or special characters** in file names
- [ ] **No timestamps** in file name — content description, not capture date
- [ ] **Prefix by type** optionally — `ui-`, `diagram-`, `icon-`

### Alt Text (detectable from markdown)

- [ ] **All informative images have alt** — `![alt](image.png)` not `![](image.png)`
- [ ] **Decorative images have empty alt** — `![](decoration.png)`
- [ ] **Alt describes content** — "Workspace settings with API key field" not "Screenshot"
- [ ] **Alt is not "image of" / "screenshot of"** — screen reader already announces it
- [ ] **Length ≤ 125 characters** — longer descriptions go in the body

### UI Screenshots

- [ ] **Cropped to the relevant area** — not the full browser window with chrome
- [ ] **No personal data** — use test accounts, placeholder names/emails
- [ ] **No timestamps visible** on the screenshot itself (they go stale)
- [ ] **Important area is highlighted** — box, arrow, or highlight overlay
- [ ] **Consistent theme** — all screenshots in light mode OR all in dark mode

### Screenshot Freshness (local repo check)

Screenshots older than 180 days in an actively developed product are very likely stale:

```bash
# Screenshots older than 180 days
find . -name '*.png' -mtime +180 -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

From Docsbook MCP: check `last_updated` of pages containing screenshots — if a page hasn't been updated in 180+ days and contains screenshots, flag for manual review.

### Videos

- [ ] **Captions/subtitles** on all videos
- [ ] **Transcript or summary** in the page text
- [ ] **Not auto-play**
- [ ] **Described in text before the embed** — what the video shows, how long it is
- [ ] **Hosted externally** — YouTube, Loom, Vimeo — not committed as a file

### Diagrams

- [ ] **Mermaid in markdown** for flowcharts, architecture, ER diagrams:
  ````
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
    GitHub --> Docsbook
    Docsbook --> CDN
    CDN --> Users
  ```
  ````
- [ ] **Source file saved** alongside PNG export — `.excalidraw`, `.drawio` — so diagrams can be updated
- [ ] **Text alternative** for complex diagrams that can't be Mermaid
- [ ] **Readable in both light and dark mode**

## What to Look For

| Severity | Problem | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| `critical` | Informative image with no alt | `![]()` in markdown |
| `high` | PNG > 1 MB | `find` by size (local) |
| `high` | Generic filename — `screenshot1.png`, `image.png` | Regex on image links in markdown |
| `high` | Video file committed to repo (> 5 MB) | `find *.mp4 *.mov` (local) |
| `high` | JPG used for UI screenshot | `.jpg` extension on UI images |
| `high` | Full browser screenshot (not cropped) | Width > 1500px (local exif/identify) |
| `medium` | GIF > 2 MB | `find` by size (local) |
| `medium` | Screenshot on a page not updated in 180+ days | Page `last_updated` + image presence |
| `medium` | Static PNG diagram that could be Mermaid | PNG with architecture/flow content |
| `medium` | Video without caption note | No "captions" / "transcript" near embed |
| `low` | Timestamp in filename | Regex `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}` in filename |
| `low` | Missing highlight on screenshot | No mention of highlight/annotation |

## Task-Specific Questions

When invoked directly, ask:

1. **Is local repo access available?** File size and age checks require it.
2. **What's the screenshot freshness threshold?** Default is 180 days.
3. **Convert PNG diagrams to Mermaid?** Or just report them?
